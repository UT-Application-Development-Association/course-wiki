## Course Introduction
This course is one of the most difficult in the freshman math class. The difficulty is roughly tied with MAT247 but the content is not the same. The former is microintegration and the latter is linear algebra. It can be said that 157 is an upgraded version of MAT137, but I personally think 157 It is not the same as 137, because this class is very abstract and requires talent.

Compared with 137, 157 has very little calculation and a lot of proofs, requiring a lot of theories and definitions. Because most of the time there is no fixed answer to the method of proof, there can be many methods, and there is no fixed format, so how to prove that sometimes depends entirely on your mind. The knowledge you learn can only be given to you in many cases. A general proof direction. This also shows that this class can not only be solved by brushing the questions, but also requires strong logical thinking and understanding skills, but also very rigorous. But doing more questions is definitely helpful, because you can learn more proof methods and problem-solving ideas. The homework questions are basically big questions, which are very time-consuming, but the exam questions will have about 30-50% calculations so it is more friendly, but the exam time is somewhat short.

Although according to the professor and TA, this course is not completely proof based, but the proof is already a lot of the freshman course. If you have studied CSC165 this course, you may have some basic understanding of the proof but it is also very different. The 157 proof has no format and is very abstract. It just says that proofs are probably derived from several basic proof methods: induction, contradiction, direct, etc.

If you haven't had any contact with proof before, then this class may be more difficult, but there are some students who are very talented in proving this, so it is very suitable. If you are a freshman and want to take this course, I recommend you to take a preparatory course for UT summer vacation, PUMP2. In this class, there will be some things that high school will not teach basically, and 157 will need things, such as induction, axioms and the like, which will make the first half of 157 a lot easier.

If you don’t have a special need but just want to challenge yourself, you don’t need to take this course. At the beginning of this course, the professor will persuade the professor to dismiss it. It probably means that this course is not suitable for people who like mathematics and those who like to challenge themselves. This course is for those who want to be a specialist, and not every math specialist. This lesson is needed. I suggest that you can search for some past years to see if you are suitable for this difficulty. And it is recommended to look at the assignment questions because the difficulty of the exam questions is not too outrageous. Once you find something wrong, run away immediately without hesitation.

Be sure to do your homework seriously, go to the tutorial, some TAs will give some hints on the homework, so be sure to go. Be sure to read the textbook and read the questions.

## General course design
The following courses are from 2020Winter-2021Fall. Due to the epidemic, the courses have been simplified and the final exam has been cancelled:

-18 Homework Problemsets 60% (difficulty, five major problems, deadly problems)
-9 Quizzes 40% (the difficulty is medium to high, the test time is one hour)

You can drop the two lowest-scoring assignments and the lowest-scoring quiz.

## Permanent Professor
-Prof. Meinrenken
157 There is only one professor every year because there are not many classes, and they are all excellent professors. Meinrenken lectures very carefully, and if he doesn't know how to ask him, he will answer very seriously. He sometimes overdos the questions, but they are all very good questions, so you must do them seriously. The test questions will be much simpler than the homework, but don’t take it lightly. The lecture notes he made are really good. Overall, he is a very good professor.

## Course difficulty
So difficult

-Difficulty of content: 4/5 (most of the content can be understood by reading more, it is more difficult to use flexibly)

-Homework difficulty: 4.5 / 5

-Workload: 3.5 / 5 (There is only one job-problemset, but the job is very time-consuming)

-Overall difficulty: 4.5 / 5

The above is only the difficulty in my personal opinion, but it is worth mentioning that the average score will get higher and higher as the class goes on. The median of the homework is often more than 80%, which means that the difficulty may be smaller the later, and there is Generally, those who stayed are really big guys.
