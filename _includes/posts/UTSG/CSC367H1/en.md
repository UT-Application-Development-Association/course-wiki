## Course Introduction
In the history of computer development, the improvement of hardware performance is the fundamental reason to lead the technological change, and one of the most critical changes in the period is the change of computer architecture. Parallel architecture has become the most mainstream computer architecture in modern times. One of the most critical cores of parallel architecture is to support simultaneous processing of multiple tasks to improve performance. In fact, most of the time, the performance improvement brought by the parallel architecture has not been brought into full play, while CSC367 learns different models and programming uses under the parallel architecture so that it can efficiently utilize the advantages of the parallel architecture.

## Course Difficulty
In general, CSC367 is a very practical course, and the content of this course can be said to be a course that can be connected with industrial needs. Product throughput and performance have always been the top industrial requirements. The content of CSC367 also basically covers the current industrial use such as OpenMP and CUDA. After this class, your operation and understanding of threads will rise to a great level, and the use of threads will help you optimize your program to run faster. However, the overall workload of this class is relatively large, especially the debug in the homework and project. The multi-threaded debugging is very brain-consuming and time-consuming, and after the homework is completed, it is necessary to organize the data and write the report, which is also relatively time-consuming. a part of . So be sure to pay attention to the time allocation in advance.
