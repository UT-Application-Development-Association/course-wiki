## Course Introduction

This course introduces the data structure of one of the computer troikas, mainly introducing common abstract data types (Abstract Data Type) and the data structure (Data Structure) that implements them. The teaching method is usually to ask a question, think about the ADT that solves the problem and the common data structure that can realize it, explain their realization principle and analyze the complexity. In the learning process, thinking about the difference between ADT and Data Structure as abstract concept and concrete implementation will give you a deeper understanding of the meaning of the course and help future learning. The content of this course is widely used and appropriate in depth. In the internship interview, relevant questions are often asked. These concepts are sometimes required to be used in the coding test. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully master the content of this course.

ADT is an abstraction of data, which defines the operations and functions that data needs to implement; while Data Structure is the concrete realization and algorithm of ADT.

The ADTs you will encounter include:

1. Priority Queue-Heap
2. Dictionary-Balanced Tree (AVL Tree)
3. Dictionary-Hash
4. Disjoint Sets

At the same time, important knowledge points include:

-Augmentation Data Structure
-Average Runtime Complexity
-QuickSort
-Amortized Analysis
-Dynamic Array
-Graph
  -Breadth First Search
  -Depth First Search
  -Topological Sort
  -Minimum Spanning Tree
  -Prim's Algorithm
  -Kruskal's Algorithm

A little knowledge of Statistic (Probability, Expectation, Combination and Permutation) is required to calculate the complexity.

## Course difficulty

In the course, you will learn a lot of data structures, and you need to understand and be familiar with their goal, intuition, implementation, and complexity. The understanding of the actual concept is not complicated. The difficulty of the course is to use the knowledge learned flexibly, analyze the target problem, and propose a reasonable algorithm and Augmented Data Structure.
